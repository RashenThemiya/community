          "description": "The vegetable prices at the Dambulla Special Economic Center are determined based on supply and demand principles. In some cases, farmers are unable to cover their production costs, putting them in a difficult situation. Since the price determination is solely based on supply and demand, management has limited control over the prices. Therefore, we are taking several steps to stabilize vegetable prices."
